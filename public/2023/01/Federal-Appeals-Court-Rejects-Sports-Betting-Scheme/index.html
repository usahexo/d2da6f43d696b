            <h1 id="Federal-Appeals-Court-Rejects-Sports-Betting-Scheme"><a href="#Federal-Appeals-Court-Rejects-Sports-Betting-Scheme" class="headerlink" title="Federal Appeals Court Rejects Sports Betting Scheme"></a>Federal Appeals Court Rejects Sports Betting Scheme</h1><p>The U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a ruling rejecting a sports betting scheme proposed by the state of New Jersey. The court ruled that the federal prohibition on sports betting, contained in the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), was constitutional.</p>
<p>In 2012, New Jersey voters approved a referendum authorizing sports betting in the state. In an effort to bring sports betting to its casinos and racetracks, the state legislature subsequently enacted a law permitting such gambling. But the Federal government quickly moved to stop New Jersey, filing a lawsuit seeking to have the new law struck down.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Third Circuit upheld a lower court’s ruling that PASPA was constitutional. In its decision, the appeals court wrote that “the challenged legislation violates PASPA because it authorizes state-sponsored sports wagering”.</p>
<p>New Jersey Governor Chris Christie responded to the ruling by vowing to take the fight to the Supreme Court. “I am confident that when the highest court in the land hears this case, they will rule in our favor and New Jersey will be able to harness the billions of dollars in economic activity and tax revenue that sports betting generates”, he said.</p>
<p>The case is being closely watched by other states interested in legalizing sports betting, including Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Mississippi. All four of those states have laws on their books that are similar to New Jersey’s 2012 law, but have not yet moved to implement them.</p>
<h1 id="Court-Rules-against-Sports-Betting-Operation"><a href="#Court-Rules-against-Sports-Betting-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Court Rules against Sports Betting Operation"></a>Court Rules against Sports Betting Operation</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against New Jersey in a case concerning sports betting. In a 6-3 vote, the court determined that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) prohibits states from authorizing sports betting.</p>
<p>The state of New Jersey had argued that PASPA violates the Tenth Amendment by commandeering states to maintain a prohibition on sports betting that they might not otherwise have chosen to implement. The Tenth Amendment reserves certain powers for the states, including the power to regulate intrastate commerce.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the Court. He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case.</p>
<p>Alito began his opinion by noting that “[t]his case is about power—the Federal Government’s power to regulate state governments’ regulation of their citizens’ recreational activities.” He went on to say that while Congress has broad authority to regulate interstate commerce, it may not compel states to carry out its policies.</p>
<p>The majority held that PASPA does just that by prohibiting state-authorized sports betting, even if that activity would only take place within state borders. The majority rejected New Jersey’s argument that PASPA violates the Tenth Amendment because it regulates state governments rather than individual citizens. According to Alito, PASPA does not “commandeer” states into regulating their citizens but instead bars them from authorizing such regulation themselves.</p>

<p>In his dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer argued that PASPA should be interpreted more narrowly to avoid unconstitutionality. He noted that most other federal laws regulating state behavior are triggered only when a state takes specific action, such as raising its tax rates above certain levels or implementing certain regulations. By contrast, PASPA prohibits all forms of state-authorized sports betting whether or not they conflict with federal policy.</p>
<p>Justice Breyer warned that if Congress were allowed to prohibit states from taking any action it disapproves of, then “much of our constitutional structure would founder…leaving us with a Constitution that speaks in general terms and leaves it to majorities in each House of Congress to fashion detailed rules as they see fit.”</p>
<h1 id="Federal-Appeals-Court-Rejects-Baltimore-Sport-Betting-Scheme"><a href="#Federal-Appeals-Court-Rejects-Baltimore-Sport-Betting-Scheme" class="headerlink" title="Federal Appeals Court Rejects Baltimore Sport Betting Scheme"></a>Federal Appeals Court Rejects Baltimore Sport Betting Scheme</h1><p>On July 11, the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled that a 2006 law enabling Baltimore and other Maryland counties to operate sports betting schemes violated the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution. The court’s decision effectively ends legalized sports betting in Maryland, although individual casinos and racetracks may still offer it through separate arrangements with gaming providers.</p>
<p>The case, which was brought by the state of New Jersey, revolved around a federal law passed in 2006 known as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). That law prohibited financial institutions from processing payments related to online gambling, but it also included a carve-out for states that had already legalized some form of sports betting.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of that carve-out, states needed to pass laws authorizing their specific sports betting schemes. Maryland did so in 2006, with Baltimore among the localities authorized to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>But in 2012, New Jersey voters approved a referendum legalizing all forms of sports betting within the state. The following year, New Jersey passed a law authorizing such betting, but it was quickly challenged in federal court by the NCAA and major professional sports leagues.</p>
<p>The case made its way up to the US Supreme Court, which in 2018 sided with New Jersey and struck down the federal ban on sports betting as unconstitutional. However, that ruling only applied to New Jersey and other states that chose to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court’s decision. It did not overturn the Maryland law or others like it that were passed before 2018.</p>
<p>The 4th Circuit’s ruling this month thus upholds those earlier laws while striking down New Jersey’s attempt to circumvent them. The decision is a blow to both the state of New Jersey and to casino operators in Baltimore and other parts of Maryland who were hoping to benefit from legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Court-Dismisses-Sports-Betting-Case"><a href="#Maryland-Court-Dismisses-Sports-Betting-Case" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Court Dismisses Sports Betting Case"></a>Maryland Court Dismisses Sports Betting Case</h1><p><em>The United States District Court for the District of Maryland dismissed a case on Monday that sought to legalize sports betting in the state.</em></p>
<p>Judge Catherine C. Blake ruled that the plaintiffs, which included Baltimore Orioles owner Peter G. Angelos, did not have standing to bring the case. The plaintiffs had argued that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 was unconstitutional because it violated the Tenth Amendment by regulating states’ rights.</p>
<p>The court disagreed, writing that “the regulation of gaming is a traditionally exclusive province of the states.”</p>
<p>“PASPA does not contravene the Tenth Amendment; it simply regulates state involvement in gambling and does not require states to take any action,” the court wrote.</p>
<p>This is a major blow to those seeking to legalize sports betting in the United States, as it makes it significantly more difficult to challenge PASPA in court.</p>
<h1 id="Federal-Court-Upholds-Ruling-Against-Baltimore-Sport-Betting-Operation"><a href="#Federal-Court-Upholds-Ruling-Against-Baltimore-Sport-Betting-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Federal Court Upholds Ruling Against Baltimore Sport Betting Operation"></a>Federal Court Upholds Ruling Against Baltimore Sport Betting Operation</h1><p>The Third Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling from the lower court that blocked a Baltimore sport betting operation, finding that the state had a valid interest in prohibiting sports betting.</p>
<p>The case centered around whether or not the state’s decades-old prohibition on sports betting violated the defendant’s constitutional rights. The appeals court found that it did not, reasoning that “the State has a valid interest in prohibiting sports betting, which is connected to important governmental interests such as protecting the integrity of sporting contests and preventing crime and corruption.”</p>
<p>The decision is a major victory for the state and for sports leagues, which have argued for years that legalization of sports betting would damage the integrity of their games. It also represents a significant setback for proponents of legalized sports betting, who argue that it would bring much-needed tax revenue to states.</p>
<p>The ruling comes as several states are moving to legalize sports betting, following a 2018 Supreme Court decision overturning a federal ban on the practice. Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania have all since legalized some form of sports betting.</p>
