            <h1 id="Legislation-allowing-sports-betting-in-Connecticut-is-introduced"><a href="#Legislation-allowing-sports-betting-in-Connecticut-is-introduced" class="headerlink" title="Legislation allowing sports betting in Connecticut is introduced"></a>Legislation allowing sports betting in Connecticut is introduced</h1><p>On January 9, 2018, Connecticut state legislators filed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The proposed bill, House Bill 7260,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> would allow casinos and off-track betting facilities in Connecticut to offer bets on professional and college sports.</p>
<p>The legislation is sponsored by Representative Joe Aresimowicz and Senator Tony Guglielmo.</p>
<p>“This is about putting people back to work and bringing some legalese to an industry that’s been operating in the shadows for years,” said Aresimowicz.</p>
<p>Guglielmo added that the state could expect to see around $30 million in annual revenue from sports betting.</p>
<p>Governor Dannel Malloy has signaled his support for the measure, stating that it would create jobs and generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to gambling addiction and other social problems. They also maintain that it is unconstitutional because it violates a federal law which prohibits states from authorizing sports betting.</p>
<p>If passed, Connecticut would join five other states – Delaware, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Oregon – that have legalized some form of sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Poll-Shows-Majority-of-Connecticut-Residents-Support-Legal-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Poll-Shows-Majority-of-Connecticut-Residents-Support-Legal-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Poll Shows Majority of Connecticut Residents Support Legal Sports Betting"></a>Poll Shows Majority of Connecticut Residents Support Legal Sports Betting</h1><p>According to a recent poll, the majority of Connecticut residents support the legalization of sports betting. The poll, which was conducted by Quinnipiac University, found that 56 percent of respondents support legalizing sports betting, while 33 percent are opposed.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Quinnipiac University has polled Connecticut residents on the issue of sports betting. In August 2017, the same poll found that 54 percent of residents supported legalization, while 36 percent were opposed.</p>
<p>Despite this level of public support, efforts to legalize sports betting in Connecticut have thus far been unsuccessful. In June 2017, the state legislature passed a bill that would have legalized sports betting, but Governor Dannel Malloy vetoed it.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been several attempts to override the veto, but all of them have failed. Most recently, in May 2018, lawmakers in the House of Representatives fell two votes short of overriding the veto.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting in Connecticut argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state. They also say that it would create jobs and help tourism.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalization argue that it would lead to increased gambling addiction and other social ills. They also argue that it would damage the integrity of sporting events.</p>
<h1 id="State-Senate-Passes-Legislation-Allowing-Sports-Betting"><a href="#State-Senate-Passes-Legislation-Allowing-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="State Senate Passes Legislation Allowing Sports Betting"></a>State Senate Passes Legislation Allowing Sports Betting</h1><p>On Tuesday, the state Senate passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state of New Jersey. The vote was 27-5, with all Republicans voting in favor and all Democrats voting against.</p>
<p>The legislation now moves to the state Assembly, where it is expected to pass. Once it is signed by Governor Murphy, sports betting will be legal in New Jersey.</p>
<p>State Senator Raymond Lesniak sponsored the bill and said that it would create jobs and generate tax revenue for the state.</p>
<p>“This is about creating jobs and generating tax revenue for our state,” Lesniak said. “It’s also about having fun and giving people an opportunity to make some extra money.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to gambling addiction and other social ills. But supporters say that sports betting can be properly regulated and that it is already happening illegally.</p>
<p>“It’s happening anyway,” Lesniak said. “We might as well get some tax revenue from it.”</p>
<h1 id="Gov-Malloy-Signs-Bill-Allowing-Sports-Betting-in-Connecticut"><a href="#Gov-Malloy-Signs-Bill-Allowing-Sports-Betting-in-Connecticut" class="headerlink" title="Gov. Malloy Signs Bill Allowing Sports Betting in Connecticut"></a>Gov. Malloy Signs Bill Allowing Sports Betting in Connecticut</h1><p>On Wednesday, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy announced that he had signed a bill legalizing sports betting in the state. The bill had been passed by the state legislature earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The bill will allow sports betting at state-licensed casinos and online. It will also allow bets on professional and collegiate sporting events. The regulations for sports betting are expected to be finalized later this year.</p>
<p>Governor Malloy said that the new law would provide much-needed revenue for the state. He added that it would also create jobs and boost tourism.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill have raised concerns about gambling addiction and other negative effects of legalized sports betting. However, supporters argue that such concerns can be addressed through regulation.</p>
<p>Connecticut is one of several states that have recently legalized sports betting following a Supreme Court ruling last year striking down a federal ban on the practice.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Connecticut-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>Connecticut Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>On Wednesday, October 10th, 2018, the state of Connecticut became the latest in a growing list of states to legalize sports betting following the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn the federal ban on the practice.</p>
<p>The law, which was passed by the Connecticut General Assembly and signed by Governor Dannel Malloy, allows for sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. The legislation stipulates that wagers can only be placed on professional and collegiate sporting events, but does not place any restrictions on what types of bets can be made.</p>
<p>While it is unclear exactly when sports gambling will be up and running in Connecticut, officials say they are aiming to have everything in place by early 2019. The exact tax rates that will be levied on gaming revenues have yet to be determined as well.</p>
<p>This comes as good news for casino operators in Connecticut, who have been eagerly awaiting a resolution to the sports betting debate. In anticipation of legalization, MGM Resorts International has announced plans to invest $50 million into its facilities in Springfield and Stamford. similarly, Hard Rock International has said it will pump an additional $5 million into its casino project in Atlantic City contingent upon New Jersey legalizing sports betting.</p>
<p>“Today is a great day for Connecticut as we join dozens of other states that have recognized the natural evolution of gambling laws and seized this important new opportunity to generate revenue for our state and support our local businesses,” said Governor Malloy in a statement following the signing of the bill.</p>
<p>Connecticut is now one of eight states that have legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court issued its ruling in May. The others are Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Nevada.</p>
