            <h1 id="Panthers-Find-Blackjack-Slot-in-NFC-South"><a href="#Panthers-Find-Blackjack-Slot-in-NFC-South" class="headerlink" title="Panthers Find Blackjack Slot in NFC South!"></a>Panthers Find Blackjack Slot in NFC South!</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers have been divisional doormats for the last two seasons. A lot of that can be attributed to the success of their division rivals, the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons. But with both of those teams taking a step back in 2017, the Panthers have a chance to capitalize and reestablish themselves as a force in the NFC South.</p>
<p>One of the keys for Carolina will be finding success in the blackjack slot. That is, they need to win close games. In 2016, the Panthers were 2-5 in games decided by 7 points or less. Last season, that number improved to 5-2, but was still below average.</p>
<p>Close games are often decided by who has the ball last. That’s why it’s important for the Panthers to have a strong running game. Christian McCaffrey and Jonathan Stewart provide a one-two punch that can wear down defenses and control the clock.</p>
<p>outside of the divisional matchups, carolina also has some difficult contests against teams such as new orleans, minnesota, atlanta, pittsburgh and oakland on their schedule. but with an improved defense and an offense that can move the football, there’s no reason carolina can’t compete with anyone in 2018</p>
<h1 id="Panthers-Win-Sixth-Consecutive-Game-with-Blackjack-Slot"><a href="#Panthers-Win-Sixth-Consecutive-Game-with-Blackjack-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Panthers Win Sixth Consecutive Game with Blackjack Slot"></a>Panthers Win Sixth Consecutive Game with Blackjack Slot</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers won their sixth consecutive game on Sunday with a 22-10 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Panthers got off to a slow start, but scored 16 unanswered points in the second half to seal the victory.</p>
<p>Cam Newton played another efficient game, completing 15 of 27 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns. Newton also rushed for 31 yards on six carries. Christian McCaffrey was the team’s leading rusher, with 66 yards on 12 carries.</p>
<p>The Panthers defense was solid once again, holding the Buccaneers to just 10 points and 255 total yards. Julius Peppers continued his resurgence at age 37, recording two sacks and four tackles. Luke Kuechly led the team with eight tackles and an interception.</p>
<p>With the win, the Panthers improve to 7-3 on the season and remain in first place in the NFC South. They will host the New York Jets next week in their quest for an eighth consecutive win.</p>
<h1 id="Win-Streak-at-6-After-Beating-Buccaneers-with-Blackjack-Slot"><a href="#Win-Streak-at-6-After-Beating-Buccaneers-with-Blackjack-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Win Streak at 6 After Beating Buccaneers with Blackjack Slot"></a>Win Streak at 6 After Beating Buccaneers with Blackjack Slot</h1><p>A six-game winning streak has the Raiders feeling good about their prospects for the playoffs. After Saturday’s 34-14 win over the Buccaneers, the team is now in a good position to make a run at the postseason. The key to the win was a big day from the Blackjack Slot machine.</p>
<p>The Blackjack Slot was rolling early and often on Saturday, resulting in a number of touchdowns for the Raiders. Derek Carr was able to connect with Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper for big plays, thanks in part to the protection provided by the Blackjack Slot. With its imposing size and impressive blocking ability, the Blackjack Slot is quickly becoming one of the most feared players on offense.</p>
<p>The strong play of the Blackjack Slot has helped to mask some of Oakland’s other deficiencies on offense. The running game continues to struggle, as Latavius Murray has been unable to find consistent success. However, if Murray can continue to get into the end zone, it won’t matter quite as much.</p>
<p>The defense has also been playing well lately, shutting down opponents’ top players. Khalil Mack had another big game against Tampa Bay, recording five tackles and two sacks. Mack is quickly emerging as one of the league’s top defensive players and looks poised to have another All-Pro season.</p>
<p>Overall, things are looking up for the Raiders as they head into the second half of the season. With an offense that is starting to click and a defense that is starting to dominate, Oakland is beginning to look like a real playoff contender.</p>
<h1 id="5-0-Panthers-Finally-Meet-a-Team-Who-Can-Beat-Them-They-Play-the-Saints-in-Blackjack-Slot"><a href="#5-0-Panthers-Finally-Meet-a-Team-Who-Can-Beat-Them-They-Play-the-Saints-in-Blackjack-Slot" class="headerlink" title="5-0 Panthers Finally Meet a Team Who Can Beat Them: They Play the Saints in Blackjack Slot"></a>5-0 Panthers Finally Meet a Team Who Can Beat Them: They Play the Saints in Blackjack Slot</h1><p>It was déjà vu all over again for the Carolina Panthers last weekend as they found themselves in a shootout with the Atlanta Falcons. Cam Newton and the offense looked unstoppable in the first half, putting up 24 points, but they were only able to muster six more in the second half. The Panthers defense once again looked vulnerable, giving up 38 points and 410 yards of total offense.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Carolina, they will have a chance to redeem themselves this weekend as they take on the New Orleans Saints. The Saints are coming into this game with a 2-3 record, but they have already shown that they can compete with the best teams in the league. In Week 1, New Orleans took on the Minnesota Vikings and came away with a 29-19 victory. And in Week 5, they played the Detroit Lions close before losing 28-31.</p>
<p>The Panthers should be favored in this game, but it’s definitely not going to be easy. The Saints have one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL, led by Drew Brees and Alvin Kamara. And their defense has been much improved this year, thanks to rookie standout Marcus Davenport.</p>
<p>This is going to be an exciting matchup between two of the best teams in the NFC South. I’m predicting that Carolina will come out on top, but it won’t be easy. They’ll need to score early and often to keep up with Brees and company.</p>
<h1 id="Panthers-Go-0-fer-Against-Falcons-Looks-Like-They-Need-to-Find-Another-Blackjack-Slot"><a href="#Panthers-Go-0-fer-Against-Falcons-Looks-Like-They-Need-to-Find-Another-Blackjack-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Panthers Go 0-fer Against Falcons; Looks Like They Need to Find Another Blackjack Slot"></a>Panthers Go 0-fer Against Falcons; Looks Like They Need to Find Another Blackjack Slot</h1><p>In a game where they were heavily favored, the Carolina Panthers couldn’t get it done against the Atlanta Falcons. They are now 0-2 on the season, and will need to scramble to fix a few things before their matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
<p>There were some bright spots for the Panthers. Christian McCaffrey totaled 128 yards from scrimmage and looked like he could be a dual threat for Carolina this year. However, the rest of the offense was fairly anemic. Cam Newton threw for only 166 yards and had an interception; Kelvin Benjamin was held to only one catch for eight yards.</p>
<p>The defense also had a rough outing. They allowed Julio Jones to haul in 12 catches for300 yards and two touchdowns. Overall, it was just not a good day for Carolina.</p>
<p>It’s still early in the season, but these struggles could spell trouble down the road if they don’t correct them soon. The Panthers will have to face some tough opponents in their division, so they can’t afford to start out slow like this.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how they bounce back in their next game against Cincinnati.</p>
