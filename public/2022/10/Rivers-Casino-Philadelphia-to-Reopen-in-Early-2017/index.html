            <h1 id="Rivers-Casino-Philadelphia-to-Reopen-in-Early-2017"><a href="#Rivers-Casino-Philadelphia-to-Reopen-in-Early-2017" class="headerlink" title="Rivers Casino Philadelphia to Reopen in Early 2017"></a>Rivers Casino Philadelphia to Reopen in Early 2017</h1><p>After a nearly two-year closure for renovations, Rivers Casino Philadelphia is set to reopen in early 2017. The casino announced the reopening date on its website, and said that there would be a number of new features and attractions when it reopens.</p>
<p>The casino closed in March 2015 for a $125 million renovation project. The work included an expansion of the gaming floor, the addition of a high-limit gaming area, and the creation of a new VIP lounge. The renovation also included the redesign of the hotel lobby, restaurant, and conference center.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Philadelphia is one of 10 casinos operated by Rush Street Gaming. In addition to its Pennsylvania locations, Rush Street Gaming also operates casinos in Illinois, Indiana, and New York.</p>
<h1 id="Rivers-Casino-Philadelphia-Closed-for-Renovations"><a href="#Rivers-Casino-Philadelphia-Closed-for-Renovations" class="headerlink" title="Rivers Casino Philadelphia Closed for Renovations"></a>Rivers Casino Philadelphia Closed for Renovations</h1><p>The Rivers Casino Philadelphia is now closed for renovations, according to an announcement made by the casino on Tuesday. The closure will last until early 2020, and the casino plans to reopen with a “new look and feel” that will include new gaming and dining options.</p>
<p>This announcement came just days after the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board released its annual report on the state’s casino industry. The report showed that gross revenues from casinos in the state had increased by 2.5% in 2018, reaching a total of $2.3 billion. Even though the Rivers Casino Philadelphia saw its gross revenues decline by 4.7% last year, it was still one of the more profitable casinos in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>So why is the casino now closing for renovations? It seems likely that the owners are looking to capitalize on the increasing profits being generated by casinos in Pennsylvania and want to make sure that their own casino is keeping pace. In addition, there may also be concerns about diminishing returns at the Rivers Casino Philadelphia, as gambling preferences continue to shift towards online casinos and sports betting.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for the closure, it will undoubtedly be a major inconvenience for players who rely on the Rivers Casino Philadelphia for their gambling needs. Hopefully, when it reopens in early 2020, the casino will have made some significant improvements that will justify the inconvenience.</p>
<h1 id="Rivers-Casino-Set-to-Reopen-in-January-with-New-Look-and-Feel"><a href="#Rivers-Casino-Set-to-Reopen-in-January-with-New-Look-and-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Rivers Casino Set to Reopen in January with New Look and Feel"></a>Rivers Casino Set to Reopen in January with New Look and Feel</h1><p>The Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, Illinois is set to reopen in January of 2020 after being closed for renovations since February of 2019. The casino has undergone a $350 million renovation project, which has seen the addition of new restaurants, bars, and a hotel.</p>
<p>The casino floor has also been completely redesigned, with new games and slot machines added. There is also a new sportsbook at the casino, which will offer wagering on both collegiate and professional sports.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino CEO Greg Carlin said that the casino is “revamped and refreshed” and that he is excited to reopen it to the public. He added that the casino is now “the place to be in the Chicagoland area.”</p>
<p>The Rivers Casino first opened in 2011 and has been a popular destination for gamblers ever since. It is one of the largest casinos in Illinois, with over 100,000 square feet of gaming space.</p>

These games include popular titles such as <strong>The Walking Dead</strong>, <strong>Luau Loot</strong>, and <strong>Crystal Forest</strong>.</p>
<p>This expansion of the casino floor follows the successful launch of the <strong>Wheel of Fortune Double Diamond Deluxe</strong> machine in late November. This game has been extremely popular with guests and has generated record profits for the casino.</p>
<p>With the addition of these new machines, Rivers Casino now offers one of the largest selection of slots in Pennsylvania. Guests can enjoy over 2,200 different games across all denominations, including penny slots, nickel slots, quarter slots, dollar slots, and high limit slots.</p>
<p>“We are always looking for ways to improve the guest experience and offer more excitement and variety” said Craig Clark, Regional President of Rivers Casino. “The new games from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are a great addition to our floor and we know our guests will enjoy playing them.”</p>

<h1 id="Rivers-Casino-Philadelphia-to-Unveil-New-Gaming-Floor"><a href="#Rivers-Casino-Philadelphia-to-Unveil-New-Gaming-Floor" class="headerlink" title="Rivers Casino Philadelphia to Unveil New Gaming Floor"></a>Rivers Casino Philadelphia to Unveil New Gaming Floor</h1><p>Rivers Casino Philadelphia is set to unveil its new gaming floor on Thursday, September 6th. The casino has been closed since July so that the renovations could take place.</p>
<p>The revamped gaming floor will now include a new poker room, Rivers’ first race and sports book, and a lounge overlooking the gaming area. There will also be several new slot machines and table games added to the mix.</p>
<p>Construction on the $90 million project began in February and is expected to create about 300 temporary construction jobs and 100 full-time positions when it’s completed.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Philadelphia is one of 10 casinos in Pennsylvania. It opened in 2009 and features more than 2,000 slot machines and 101 table games.</p>
