<p>Congratulations! You’ve now got the car in the casino. Head over to the elevator and take it up to the roof. Park the car in the designated area and enjoy your secret romance game.</p>

<ul>

</li>
<li><p>Roulette: To play roulette, first decide how much money you want to bet. You can then place your bets on either red or black, odd or even, or one of the numbers on the table. When it’s your turn, spin the wheel and see where the ball lands. If your bet is correct, you’ll winnings will be multiplied by your original bet amount.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blackjack: In blackjack, your aim is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. The dealer will also take cards until they reach 21 or hit stick, at which point whoever has 21 or closest automatically wins. To play blackjack, first place your bet and then choose whether to hit (take another card), stand (stick with what you have), double down (double your bet and take one more card) or split (split two cards of equal value).</p>
