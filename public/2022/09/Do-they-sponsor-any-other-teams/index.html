Fnatic sponsors only the best teams in the world and provides them with the best gaming gear to give them an edge over the competition.</p>
<p>Fnatic doesn’t just sponsor teams, they also provide their players with top of the line gaming gear to give them a competitive edge. Some of their sponsored teams include:</p>
<p>-Counter-Strike: Global Offensive<br>-League of Legends<br>-Dota 2<br>-Hearthstone<br>-Overwatch</p>
<h1 id="How-many-years-have-they-been-in-business"><a href="#How-many-years-have-they-been-in-business" class="headerlink" title="How many years have they been in business?"></a>How many years have they been in business?</h1><p>Comparison and contrast of two very different businesses, both of which have been in business for many years.</p>
<p>The first business is a small, independently-owned restaurant that has been in business for over 25 years. The second is a multinational corporation that sells consumer goods.</p>
<p>The restaurant has a very personal touch, with the owner often greeting customers and getting to know them on a personal level. The corporation, on the other hand, is very faceless; customers cannot even speak to someone on the phone about their order.</p>
<p>The restaurant offers a wide variety of homemade dishes, while the corporation sells mostly pre-packaged items. The restaurant has a cozy, intimate atmosphere, while the corporation’s stores are bright and sterile.</p>
<p>The restaurant is relatively expensive, while the corporation’s prices are very affordable. The restaurant focuses on quality rather than quantity, while the corporation tries to sell as many items as possible.</p>
<p>Both businesses have been successful for many years, but they offer radically different experiences to their customers.</p>
