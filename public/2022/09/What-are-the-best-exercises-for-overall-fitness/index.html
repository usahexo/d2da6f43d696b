It can also help increase bone density, making you less likely to suffer from osteoporosis later in life.</p>
<p>Finally, another exercise that is beneficial for overall fitness is yoga. Yoga can help improve flexibility, strength, and balance. It can also help improve breathing and concentration, and can be helpful in combating stress and anxiety.</p>

But it’s not impossible. Here are some tips that can help you make fitness a priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>Schedule your workouts in advance.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you know ahead of time when you’re going to work out, it will be easier to stick to your routine. Try to schedule your workouts for times when you know you’re usually free.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Find a workout buddy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Working out with a friend can make it more fun and less intimidating. Plus, having someone to hold you accountable can help keep you on track.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make time for fitness in your daily routine.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can find ways to fit fitness into your everyday life, it’ll be easier to stick to it over the long term. Taking a walk during your lunch break or going for a bike ride after work are both great ways to get in some exercise without having to set aside extra time specifically for working out.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Set small goals and celebrate accomplishments along the way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t try to overhaul your entire lifestyle all at once. Start by setting small goals and gradually work your way up. When you reach a goal, celebrate with a new workout clothes or by treating yourself to a healthy snack.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Find an activity that you enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not everyone enjoys running or lifting weights at the gym. If you’re dreading your workouts, it’s going to be tough to stick with them in the long run. Try finding an activity that you enjoy instead, like hiking, swimming or dance classes.</p>
