#  What Causes Bingo Addiction?

Like any other type of addiction, bingo can be addictive because it triggers the release of feel-good chemicals in the brain. When these chemicals are released, they create a feeling of pleasure that can be addictive.

Studies have shown that bingo can release dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin. Dopamine is responsible for the "high" people feel when they do something pleasurable, such as gamble or use drugs. Serotonin is associated with happiness and well-being, while oxytocin is known as the "cuddle hormone" because it is released when people hug or cuddle.

When these chemicals are released in high amounts, they can create a feeling of euphoria that can be addictive. This is why some people become hooked on bingo and cannot resist the urge to keep playing.
