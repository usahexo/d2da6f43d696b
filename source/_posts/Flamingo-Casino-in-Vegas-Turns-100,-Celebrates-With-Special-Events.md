Guests can enjoy roulette, blackjack, craps and other classic table games in the original casino room. And for a real blast from the past, there’s a penny arcade featuring vintage games like skee ball and pinball.

The Flamingo has also resurrected its former showroom, which is now home to the “Flamingo Follies” revue. This nostalgic spectacle features showgirls and variety acts reminiscent of old Vegas.
