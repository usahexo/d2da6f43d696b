#  How to play Gemmed!?

Gemmed is an addicting and fun game that can be played on any device. The object of the game is to connect three or more of the same colored gems to make them disappear. The more gems you remove at once, the higher your score.

There are a few different ways to play Gemmed. One way is to see how long you can survive before the board fills up with gems and you lose. Another way is to see how many points you can rack up in a set amount of time.

To move the gems, swipe your finger in the direction you want them to go. If there are no moves available, the game will offer you a gem swap. Swipe in the direction of the gem you want to swap with.

You can also use bombs and stones to help clear the board. Bombs explode and destroy all surrounding gems. Stones can be used to fill up empty spaces on the board or to block your opponent’s moves.

When you make a match of four or more gems, they will turn into a stone. You cannot remove stones from the board, but they will explode when matched with another stone.

There are also power ups that appear on the board from time to time. The lightning bolt will zap all gems on the board and turn them into stones. The Hourglass will give you an extra sixty seconds to play. The Shield will protect your gems from being destroyed by bombs or stones for a short period of time.
