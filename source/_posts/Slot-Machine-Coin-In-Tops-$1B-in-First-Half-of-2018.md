#  Slot Machine Coin-In Tops $1B in First Half of 2018

The slot machine industry generated more than $1 billion in coin-in during the first half of 2018, according to figures from the casino and gaming analytics firm WagerMinds. This is a significant uptick from the same period last year, when coin-in totaled just $890 million.

The surge in slot machine revenue can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increasing popularity of casino gaming, the rising number of states that have legalized gambling, and the advent of new and innovative slot machines.

One of the most popular new slots is "Aristocrat's Lightning Link," which allows players to win jackpots of up to $1 million. Other hot new slots include "Bally's Timber Wolf" and "WMS Gaming's Zeus III." These games are not only entertaining but also offer some of the best odds in the casino.

It's not just new games that are driving Slot Machine revenue growth; classic favorites like "Wheel of Fortune" and "Double Diamond" continue to be popular among players. In fact, WagerMinds reports that many casinos are adding these games to their menus to appeal to a wider range of players.

All in all, it looks like the slot machine industry is heading for another record year. So if you're looking for a little excitement and want a chance to win big bucks, be sure to give the slots a try!

#  Las Vegas Slot Machine Revenue up 5.5%

LAS VEGAS: Slot machine revenue at casinos in Las Vegas was up 5.5% in August 2018 compared to the same month last year, according to figures released by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

Revenue from slots totaled $583.7 million in August, up from $550.6 million in August 2017.

The increase was due mainly to a jump in the number of machines in operation. The amount wagered on each machine also increased, but not as much as the number of machines.

“The statewide slot win per unit was $223 in August 2018 versus $211 in August 2017,” the report said.

The average casino saw its slot machine revenue increase by 2.8%.

The largest increase was at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, where revenue was up 13%. The smallest increase was at the Downtown Grand, which saw a 0.5% uptick.

#  Slot Machine Coin-In Rebounds in Pennsylvania After Recent Slump

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board reported that slot machine coin-in rebounded in May after a slump in April. In May, the state’s casino operators took in $223.8 million from slots, up 3.6% from the $216 million taken in during the same month last year.

It was the first time since February that monthly slot revenues topped $200 million. The uptick in May was attributed to an increase in play by Pennsylvania residents, as well as visitors from other states.

In April, slot machine revenue fell 2.7% to $209 million. That dip marked the third consecutive month of year-over-year declines. The Gaming Control Board said that lower wagering by Pennsylvanians and a decline in traffic from out-of-state gamblers were among the factors contributing to the April slide.

Pennsylvania’s casino industry has been struggling in recent months amid increasing competition from casinos in neighboring states. In March, for example, total gaming revenue in Atlantic City was up 6.5% compared with a year ago, while revenue at Pennsylvania’s 12 casinos was down 1.4%.

The Slump Appears to be Reversing

But it now appears that the slump is reversing, at least somewhat. In May, slot machine revenue was up at six of the state’s 12 casinos, with Sands Bethlehem posting the biggest increase (16%). Revenue was down at six casinos and unchanged at one casino.

Statewide, table games revenue rose 2% in May to $53 million, while poker revenue dipped 5% to $2 million. Overall gambling revenues were up 1%, reaching $278 million.

#  Nebraska's Indian Casinos See Slot Machine Revenue Drop

According to the Nebraska Indian Gaming Association, the state's Indian casinos saw a drop in slot machine revenue of $11 million in fiscal year 2017.

The association's executive director, Darrell Smith, said that the slump is due in part to competition from new casinos in Iowa and Minnesota. He also cited a decrease in the value of the dollar against other currencies as a factor.

Revenue from slot machines at Nebraska's six Indian casinos totaled $159 million in fiscal year 2017, down from $170 million in 2016. The casinos are operated by the Omaha, Santee Sioux, Winnebago, Ponca, Ho-Chunk, and Pawnee tribes.

Smith said that the tribes are committed to their casinos and that recent investments have been made to improve customer experience. He added that the association is hopeful for a rebound in revenue this year.

#  New Jersey's Atlantic City Slot Machines Post Record Year

In 2017, Atlantic City's slot machines generated record revenue of $2.48 billion. This was an increase of 3.6% from the previous year.

The city's casinos saw a 9.2% increase in winnings from slots, and accounted for more than 80% of the total gaming revenue generated in Atlantic City last year.

The Borgata had the highest slot machine revenue of any casino in Atlantic City, generating $563 million in 2017. This was an increase of 10.5% from the previous year.

While slot machine revenue is on the rise, table game revenue continues to decline in Atlantic City. In 2017, table game revenue fell by 8.6% to $1.16 billion. This was due in part to the legalization of gambling in other states, including Pennsylvania and New York.

Atlantic City's casinos are now relying increasingly on slot machines to generate revenue, and this trend is likely to continue in 2018 and beyond.
