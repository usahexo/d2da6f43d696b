#  What happened to Trump's Taj Mahal Casino in California?

The Trump Taj Mahal Casino in California was a victim of the 2008 financial crisis and closed its doors in October of that year. The casino, which cost $1.2 billion to build, never turned a profit and filed for bankruptcy twice.

#  What caused the closure of the casino?

The closure of the casino has been a hot topic since it happened a few weeks ago. Many people are wondering what went wrong. According to some reports, there were many factors that contributed to the closure.

One of the main reasons was the high levels of debt that the casino was carrying. This was due in part to the fact that the casino was not bringing in enough money to cover its costs. In addition, there were also allegations of financial mismanagement by the owners.

Another reason for the closure was the changing landscape in the gambling industry. With new casinos popping up all over, the casino was struggling to stay competitive. This is especially true given that they did not have any major renovations in many years.

 Finally, there were also allegations of mob involvement in the casino. This is something that is still being investigated by authorities. If it is proven to be true, it would certainly be one of the main reasons for the closure.

#  Who is responsible for the closure?

The closure of the coal-fired power stations in the UK is being blamed on a number of factors, but who is really responsible for this?

There are a number of groups who could be held responsible for the closure of these power stations. One group that has been highlighted as a potential culprit is the government. The government has been accused of not doing enough to support the industry, which has led to its decline.

Another group that has been blamed for the closure is the environmentalists. They have been pushing for cleaner and more sustainable forms of energy, which has led to a decline in the use of coal-fired power stations.

However, there are also a number of other factors that have contributed to the closure of these power stations. The rise in the cost of natural gas has made it more expensive to operate these plants, and the increase in renewable energy sources has also played a role.

Ultimately, it is difficult to determine who is really responsible for the closure of these power stations. There are a number of different factors at play, and it is likely that no one group is entirely to blame. However, the government and the environmentalists are both likely to share some of the blame

#  How many people lost their jobs because of the closure?

Since the closure of Toys "R" Us, around 33,000 people have lost their jobs. This number is expected to grow as the company continues to liquidate its assets. The company has already closed more than 700 stores across the country and more are expected to be shuttered in the coming months.

#  What is Trump saying about the closure?

President Donald Trump has commented on the closure of the government, saying that he could have done better in negotiating a deal to keep it open. On Twitter, he wrote that he "left for Hawaii" on Saturday "but was told by the Democrats that I had to come back because they couldn't get their act together." 

Trump went on to say that the shutdown could have been avoided if Republicans had controlled the House of Representatives, as they do now. He also claimed that he is waiting for the Democrats to "come back from their vacation" and make a deal.

The comments from Trump come as the government shutdown enters its third week. The closure began after Congress and the White House failed to reach an agreement on funding for Trump's proposed border wall.
